2020 iGEM Hardware Project - An Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy Biosensor

By Mackenzie Sampson and Randy Moore

This code is to be used for an Arduino interfaced with the Digilent Pmod Ia Board. This board utilizes the AD5933 Impedance Analyser Integrated Circuit

Data will be uploaded to the serial monitor in .CSV format for graphing purposes.

Coaxial cables can be attached depending on sensing requirments but for our purposes we were able to place components into the coaxial slots to make measurements.

To make changes to the code, refer to the AD5933 Data sheet to ensure proper usage.
